# Shinigami Eyes (my version)

Just my version of the Shinigami Eyes browser extension. I have grievances with the main version because it is very biased, marking intersex and transmasc people as red while people who spout transphobia towards transmascs get marked green. Heck, okra is marked red somehow. So I made my own version
